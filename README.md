Walk through:   
When the user visits the site, they see the home page where they are prompted to login or register. Once logged in, their profile / personal shopping list generator is displayed. 
From here, users can build a weekly shopping list by adding recipies from their saved recipies and foods, or searching for new ones. When a recipe is added to the shopping list, it's nutrient profile is added to the nutrient counter, letting the user easily calculate and adjust. Once the list is built, users can save their list for easy use while shopping and each list can be saved as a list template.
