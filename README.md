# The Big Shop
Repository for my Capstone project


## Project Overview  
A recipe app built with the Spoonacular API. 

In my experience as a part-time househusband, I've found one of the biggest obstacles to healthy eating at home is a lack of preparation and organization. For me, aiming for one big trip to the grocery store per week helps to save time, energy, and guesswork, resulting in greater motivation to stick to the plan. This app gives you the tools to search for new recipes, track macro nutrition, create a recipe book, and build a shopping list, all with the aim of optimizing meal preperation.    

### Libraries
Django  
Vue  
Materialize  

## Functionality
Search recipies  
get ingredients and macro nutrition  
Save recipies and food profiles     
Build shopping list
